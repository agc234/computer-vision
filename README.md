This repo contains several Jupyter notebook files showcasing image manipulations using traditional and deep-learning methods.

The first three folders contain files that demonstrate Linear Algebra techniques used on images, such as:
- Least Squares Estimation
- Homographies
- Stereo Reconstruction
- Direct Linear Transform

The **Least Squares** folder applies Least Squares Estimation on an image with a gradient to estimate the gradient function and remove it.
The **Forward **
