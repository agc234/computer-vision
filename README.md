This repo contains several Jupyter notebook files showcasing image manipulations using traditional and deep-learning methods.

The folders below contain files that demonstrate Linear Algebra techniques used on images, such as:
- Least Squares Estimation
- Homographies
- Stereo Reconstruction
- Direct Linear Transform

Linear Algebra Folders:
- The **Least Squares** folder applies Least Squares Estimation on an image with a gradient to estimate the gradient function and remove it.
- The **Forward Facing Perspective** folder attempts to produce the forward facing perspective of angled rectangular faces using 4 points. Demonstrates the use of a Homography.
- The **Stereo Reconstruction** folder generates 2D camera images from a 3D house, then reconstructs the house from the 2D images using DLT.
